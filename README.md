## 1. Introduction

This project was developed to assist a professor in identifying rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in their natural habitat. The primary goal is to automate the conversion of raw acoustic data into accurate spectrograms, laying the groundwork for comprehensive future data analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis in this project begins with visualizing the spectrograms that are laden with various noises and artifacts. An initial assessment of accuracy is presented in tabular form, which establishes a benchmark for further processing and analysis.

## 3. Noise Cleaning

### 3.1 Locating the noise range

Calculated the median and IQR of the noise frequency data and then defined a range for different values of k:

For k=1, the range is from 32.737 to 33.006 kHz, which includes 82.93% of the data points.
For k=2, the range is from 32.603 to 33.140 kHz, which includes 95.72% of the data points.
For k=3, the range is from 32.468 to 33.274 kHz, which includes 96.37% of the data points.
