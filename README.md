## 1. Introduction

This project was developed to assist a professor in identifying rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in their natural habitat. The primary goal is to automate the conversion of raw acoustic data into accurate spectrograms, laying the groundwork for comprehensive future data analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis in this project begins with visualizing the spectrograms that are laden with various noises and artifacts. An initial assessment of accuracy is presented in tabular form, which establishes a benchmark for further processing and analysis.

## 3. Noise Cleaning

### 3.1 Locating the noise range

Calculated the median and IQR of the noise frequency data.

**32.468 to 33.274 kHz includes 96.37% of the points.**

### 3.2 Bandstop Filter 
Since the noise is highly concentrated in a small range of frequency, it is natuarl to use bandstop filter for noise cleaning.The bandstop filter is designed to attenuate frequencies within a defined suppression band while leaving other frequencies relatively unaffected.  
  
The filter is implemented using the scipy.signal package in Python, which provides the ‚Äòbutter‚Äô function to generate the filter coefficients (b,a) for the desired bandstop characteristics. The signal is then processed using the filter function, applying the coefficients to the input data.

| Metric      | Value (%) |
|-------------|-----------|
| Precision   | 59.87      |
| Recall      | 80.39     |
| F1-Score    | 68.63     |

### 3.2 Filtering lower frequency
Perform further analysis on lower frequencies (below 20kHz) to understand their patterns.

Noting that there is no Call under 21k Hz, so next step is to filter frequency lower than 21k Hz.

*Figure: Waveplot comparison of before and after filtering.*  

Processed audio has less variation in amplitude compared to the original, indicating that the filtering has reduced noise or unwanted frequencies, thus making the desired signal more prominent.  

*Table: Metrics After Filtering Lower Frequency*
| Metric      | Value (%) |
|-------------|-----------|
| Precision   | 62.89      |
| Recall      | 82.02     |
| F1-Score    | 71.19     |
